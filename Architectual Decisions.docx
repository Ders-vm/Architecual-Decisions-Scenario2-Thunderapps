Scenario 2:

You are a team responsible for developing a social networking mobile app for a university. The app will allow students to connect with each other, share information about classes, view events and clubs, and manage their schedules. The app will also have a feature for professors to post announcements, assignments, and grades. The following requirements must be considered:
1.	To ensure widespread adoption and accessibility, the app should support both iOS and Android platforms. The team needs to decide on a framework or technology stack that allows for efficient development and maintenance across multiple platforms.
2.	As students and professors may not always have access to a stable internet connection, the app should support offline mode to enable users to access certain features and data even when offline. The team should implement offline capabilities and data synchronization mechanisms to ensure a seamless user experience.
3.	Considering that students and professors may or may not have a top of the line smartphone, it is important to optimize the app's performance. The team should employ techniques to enhance app compatibility and minimize data usage.
4.	To secure user data and ensure appropriate access control, the team needs to integrate the app with an existing Active Directory system. Students and professors should be able to securely log in, and their roles and permissions should be properly enforced.
5.	To keep users informed about new announcements, assignment deadlines, and other relevant updates, the app should integrate with a push notification service. The team needs to select a suitable push notification provider that supports both iOS and Android platforms.
6.	As the app will handle sensitive information, such as student grades and personal profiles, the team needs to prioritize data privacy and security. The team should implement encryption, secure data transmission protocols, and adhere to relevant data protection regulations.
7.	To ensure inclusivity, the app should be designed and developed with accessibility features in mind. The team needs to consider accessibility guidelines and implement features such as text-to-speech, high contrast modes, and support for assistive technologies.

1.Native, web, or hybrid app: Hybrid app, as they offer a compromise between cross-platform 
compatibility and the performance and access to native features typically
associated with native apps. This approach allows for efficient development
and maintenance across multiple platforms while providing access to device
features and offline capabilities.

2. UI decision: React native as the The "write once, run anywhere" 
approach allows for a consistent user experience. It also provides access to
native features and performance optimization.

3. Backened languages: Node.js is known for its fast and scalable server-side runtime. 
It uses JavaScript, which aligns with the language used in React Native for the frontend.

4. Permission: granular permission model ,allows for fine-grained control 
over user access to various features and data within the app. It enables customization 
based on roles, such as student or professor, and can accommodate future expansion of user roles.

5. Data storage: Elational databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, 
provide structured data storage, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

6.Additional framework: To implement offline capabilities and data synchronization, 
frameworks like Redux or Apollo Client can be considered
